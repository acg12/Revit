# Revit

This is a personal project I created to try and delve deeper into Android.

## Overview

"Revit" is an Android application that allows its users to review and discuss books with one another in *threads*.
Currently, only admins are allowed to create new threads. Users can save a thread, can comment on a thread, and like comments on that thread.
Users can also search for threads and apply **date filters** and **sort** threads by **number of saves** and **number of comments**.
This app also provides basic functionality, such as being able to edit your username, email, password, and profile picture.
In the profile tab, you can also see the threads you saved, comments you liked, and comments you posted.

## Technical details
- This app uses Kotlin as its programming language
- Data is stored in Firestore
